# Custom Resume Template
This repo houses my custom LaTeX resume template as well as the actual resume.

## Contributing
Have any criticisms about my resume? Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/mushfiq814/resume/issues/new/choose) and tell me about it. I would greatly appreciate it!

## Compiling
Make sure `resume` is included as the document class using
```tex
\documentclass{resume}
```
This sources the `resume.cls` class.

To compile,
```sh
# compile all tex files in project root
$ xelatex *.tex
# or specify your tex file
$ xelatex myresume.tex
```
